# Coffeewatch
The frontend and a mock backend for a coffee price observatory. Frontend written in Angular and mock backend written in NodeJs with a 
Python fake data generator.

## Run it
First you will need a google api key for maps and places, which should be placed in app.module.ts,
in the place of "REDACTED".
Then run `npm install` and then `ng serve` for the frontend and `npm run start-auth` for the mock backend.
